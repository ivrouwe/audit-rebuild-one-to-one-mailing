## Methodology

I audited [One to One Mailing &amp; Marketing's home page](http://www.onetoonemailing.ca/) using Google Chrome's "Audits" panel, [the aXe accessibility extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd), [WebAIM's WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/), [the HTML5 Outliner extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html5-outliner/afoibpobokebhgfnknfndkgemglggomo?hl=en), [Google's PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), and [Think With Google's Test My Site](https://testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com/).

I will be summarizing these analyses, along with proposed solutions, in the "Areas For Improvement" section below. Where relevant, I've included quotes from people in the industry to offer further explanation for the solutions I've proposed.
